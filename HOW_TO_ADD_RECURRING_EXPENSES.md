The system calculates how many times a transaction occurs per month:

| Frequency | Per Month | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Daily | ~30 | $10/day = $300/month |
| Weekly | ~4.3 | $100/week = $430/month |
| Bi-weekly | ~2.15 | $200/bi-weekly = $430/month |
| Monthly | 1 | $500/month = $500/month |
| Quarterly | 0.33 | $1500/quarter = $500/month |
| Annual | 0.083 | $6000/year = $500/month |
